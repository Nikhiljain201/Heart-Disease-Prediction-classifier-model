Predicting if someone has Heart-Disease or not
This notebook uses python-based packages and attempts to build a Machine Learning model to check if the person is suffering from heart-disease or not based on there medical attributes.

Experimentation
1. Problem Definition:
Given clinical parameters of the statement can we predict if the patient has heart-disease or not.

2. Data
The original data came from the Cleavland data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease

Another version of the same is available of Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci

3. Evaluation
If 95% accuracy can be achieved at predicting wheather a patient has heart disease or not during the proof of concept, the project can be pursued

4. Features
This is where we can get information of the different features of the data.
